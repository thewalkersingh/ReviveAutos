I want to develop a used bike and car e-commerce app using java and spring boot for backend and using microservice architecture to manage all the features. I will use React for frontend. After completion, I will host the project. We will use latest maven and react libraries, not deprecated one. We will also maintain a README file to track the progress each day. I want to finish it in one week with at least all the basic features like listing the vehicle by admin online and performing other CRUD operations, user login, listing the vehicle, basic filtering by price, manufacturing year etc. and buy or book test drive etc. features. Later we will include other features like integrating payments, and book a service to the nearest garage etc. Hope you understood the project. Let me know if you need any further details. My app name is "ReviveAuto"
