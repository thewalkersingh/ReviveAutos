Project Plan
1. Define the Scope (Day 1)
Backend (Spring Boot Microservices):

Admin service: CRUD operations for vehicles (bikes and cars).

User service: User registration, login, and authentication (JWT).

Vehicle service: Listing vehicles, filtering by price, manufacturing year, etc.

Booking service: Book a test drive or buy a vehicle.

Frontend (React):

Admin panel: Add, update, delete, and list vehicles.

User panel: Browse vehicles, filter, book test drives, and buy.

Login/register pages.

Database:

Use MySQL or PostgreSQL for relational data (users, vehicles, bookings).

Use MongoDB (optional) for unstructured data like logs or analytics.

API Documentation:

Use Swagger for API documentation.

2. Set Up the Project (Day 1)
Backend:

Create a multi-module Maven project for microservices.

Set up Spring Boot for each microservice (Admin, User, Vehicle, Booking).

Configure Eureka Server for service discovery.

Use Spring Cloud Gateway for API gateway.

Add Spring Security for authentication and authorization.

Frontend:

Set up a React project using create-react-app.

Install necessary libraries: react-router-dom, axios, redux (optional), and material-ui or bootstrap for styling.

Database:

Set up MySQL/PostgreSQL and MongoDB (if needed).

Use Flyway or Liquibase for database migrations.

3. Develop Backend Microservices (Day 2–4)
Admin Service:

CRUD APIs for vehicles (bikes and cars).

Use Spring Data JPA for database operations.

User Service:

User registration and login APIs.

Use JWT for authentication.

Vehicle Service:

APIs to list vehicles with filters (price, year, etc.).

Use pagination for better performance.

Booking Service:

APIs to book a test drive or buy a vehicle.

Use transactional management for bookings.

Common:

Add exception handling and logging.

Use DTOs for data transfer between layers.

4. Develop Frontend (Day 5–6)
Admin Panel:

Create forms to add, update, and delete vehicles.

Display a list of vehicles in a table.

User Panel:

Create a homepage to list vehicles with filters.

Add a vehicle details page with options to book a test drive or buy.

Implement login and registration forms.

Integration:

Use axios to call backend APIs.

Handle authentication using JWT tokens.

5. Testing and Bug Fixing (Day 7)
Backend:

Write unit tests using JUnit and Mockito.

Test APIs using Postman.

Frontend:

Test all features manually.

Fix any UI/UX issues.

Integration Testing:

Ensure all microservices work together seamlessly.

6. Hosting (Day 7)
Backend:

Use Docker to containerize each microservice.

Deploy on AWS, Heroku, or any cloud platform.

Frontend:

Build the React app and deploy it on Netlify, Vercel, or S3.

Database:

Use a managed database service like AWS RDS or MongoDB Atlas.

Tech Stack
Backend:

Java 17 (latest LTS version).

Spring Boot 3.x.

Spring Cloud (Eureka, Gateway).

Spring Security with JWT.

Spring Data JPA.

MySQL/PostgreSQL.

Maven (latest version).

Frontend:

React 18.

Axios for API calls.

React Router for navigation.

Material-UI or Bootstrap for styling.

Other Tools:

Docker for containerization.

Postman for API testing.

Git for version control.

Basic Features to Implement
Admin Features:

Add, update, delete, and list vehicles.

User Features:

Register, login, and view profile.

Browse vehicles with filters (price, year, etc.).

Book a test drive or buy a vehicle.

General Features:

Responsive UI.

Authentication and authorization.

Future Features
Integrate payment gateway (Razorpay, Stripe).

Book a service at the nearest garage.

Add reviews and ratings for vehicles.

Implement advanced search and filtering.

Add notifications (email/SMS) for bookings.

Tips for Success
Prioritize Features:

Focus on the MVP first. Add advanced features later.

Use Ready-Made Libraries:

Use libraries like Material-UI or Bootstrap to speed up frontend development.

Automate Repetitive Tasks:

Use scripts for building and deploying the app.

Collaborate:

If you’re working in a team, use Git for version control and assign tasks using a project management tool like Trello or Jira.


Additional Port Configurations for Other Services
Since you have multiple services (api-gateway, eureka-server, user-service, vehicle-service, booking-service), ensure that each service runs on a unique port. Here's an example configuration for each service's application.yml:

api-gateway:
server:
  port: 8090
  
eureka-server:
server:
  port: 8761
  
admin-service:
server:
  port: 8081
 
user-service:
server:
  port: 8083
  
vehicle-service:
server:
  port: 8084
  
booking-service:
server:
  port: 8082

revive-app:
server:
  port: 8080
  
  
 To ensure that your services start in a sequential order, you'll need to configure your development environment to launch the eureka-service first, followed by the other services. You can achieve this by creating a script that starts each service in the correct order. Here's how you can do it:

Create a Startup Script
Create a Startup Script (e.g., start-services.sh):

In the root of your project directory (ReviveAutos/), create a new file named start-services.sh.

Add the following content to the script to start each service in order:

sh
#!/bin/bash

# Start Eureka Server
echo "Starting Eureka Server..."
(cd revive/eureka-server && mvn spring-boot:run) &

# Wait for Eureka Server to start (you may adjust the sleep duration if needed)
sleep 30

# Start API Gateway
echo "Starting API Gateway..."
(cd revive/api-gateway && mvn spring-boot:run) &

# Start Admin Service
echo "Starting Admin Service..."
(cd revive/admin-service && mvn spring-boot:run) &

# Start User Service
echo "Starting User Service..."
(cd revive/user-service && mvn spring-boot:run) &

# Start Vehicle Service
echo "Starting Vehicle Service..."
(cd revive/vehicle-service && mvn spring-boot:run) &

# Start Booking Service
echo "Starting Booking Service..."
(cd revive/booking-service && mvn spring-boot:run) &
Make the Script Executable:

Open a terminal and navigate to the root of your project directory (ReviveAutos/).

Run the following command to make the script executable:

sh
chmod +x start-services.sh
Run the Startup Script:

To start your services in the correct order, simply run the script:

sh
./start-services.sh
